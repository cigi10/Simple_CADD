# Verilog Syntax Explained

## Timescale

Ever seen `timescale 1ns / 1ps` at the top of a Verilog file? Hereâ€™s what it does:

- The first value (`1ns`) is the time unit, which defines the scale used for delays.
- The second value (`1ps`) is the precision, which determines how precisely time is measured in the simulation.
- Basically, it affects simulation accuracy and speed. Smaller precision values mean more accurate timing but slower simulations.

## Module

A module is like a container for your Verilog code. It defines a specific function in your design.

```verilog
module not_gate(input a, output b);
endmodule
```

- The keyword `module` is followed by the module name (`not_gate` in this case).
- Inside the parentheses, we list the inputs and outputs, separated by commas.
- Every module **must** end with `endmodule` or youâ€™ll get errors.

## Assign Statement

```verilog
assign b = ~a;
```

- `assign` is used for continuous assignments (things that always hold true, like `b` always being the NOT of `a`).
- It only works for combinational logic, meaning no memory elements.

## Always Block

```verilog
always @(posedge clk) begin
  q <= d;
end
```

- `always` is used for sequential logic or combinational logic that depends on inputs.
- `@(posedge clk)` means this block runs on every rising edge of `clk`.
- `<=` is a **non-blocking assignment** (use it for registers/flip-flops).
- If you use `=`, itâ€™s a **blocking assignment** (use it for combinational logic).

## Generate Block

```verilog
genvar i;
generate
  for (i = 0; i < 4; i = i + 1) begin : loop_name
    assign out[i] = in[i] & enable;
  end
endgenerate
```

- Used for **parameterized hardware generation** (like generating multiple instances of a module or repeated logic).
- `genvar` declares a loop variable.
- The `generate` block works like a `for` loop, but at **compile-time** (not during execution).
- The `: loop_name` part is optional but helps with debugging.

## Brackets `[ ]`

Brackets in Verilog are used in multiple ways:

### Bit-width declaration:

```verilog
reg [7:0] data;
```

- This declares `data` as an 8-bit register (bits 7 to 0).

### Bit selection:

```verilog
wire bit3 = data[3];
```

- `data[3]` accesses only bit 3 of `data`.

### Part selection:

```verilog
wire [3:0] nibble = data[7:4];
```

- `data[7:4]` extracts bits 7 to 4 (a 4-bit nibble).

### Concatenation:

```verilog
assign new_data = {data[3:0], 4'b0000};
```

- `{}` is used to combine multiple signals.
- Here, `data[3:0]` is padded with four `0`s to make an 8-bit value.

## Parameters

```verilog
parameter WIDTH = 8;
reg [WIDTH-1:0] my_reg;
```

- `parameter` lets you define constants that make your module flexible.
- This is useful for **scalability**, like defining bus widths without hardcoding them.

## Macros (`define`)

```verilog
`define ADDR_SIZE 16
wire [`ADDR_SIZE-1:0] address;
```

- Macros allow global constants and avoid hardcoding values everywhere.
- Unlike `parameter`, macros **donâ€™t** have a data type.

## One-Hot Encoding

One-hot encoding is a way to represent states where only **one** bit is high (`1`), and all others are low (`0`).

```verilog
reg [3:0] state;
always @(posedge clk) begin
  state <= 4'b0001; // Example: Setting initial state
end
```

- Used in state machines to reduce decoding logic and improve speed.
- Each state has a dedicated bit, meaning fewer errors in transitions.
- Works well for FPGA implementations due to simple decoding logic.
