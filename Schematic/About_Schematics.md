## About Schematics

- to put it simply, its a drawing of the code you gave, ie its a graphical representation of how circuits interact with each other, 
how the components are connected.
- Since we are using Vivado, its generated diretly from the RTL
- How is this useful?  When we get a gatelevel schematic, we can see what gate is in the circuit and we will be able to
  tell what is been made out of our code in under a second :)
